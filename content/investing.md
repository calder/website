Every investment must pass five tests:
1. **Scale:** Will it change the course of history if successful?
1. **Physics:** Does it violate our current understanding of the universe? [^physics]
1. **Economics:** Can it become self-sustaining?
1. **Ethics:** Will it make the world a better place? [^ethics]
1. **Team:** Do we have the right founding team?

Particular areas of interest:
* **Energy:** Safe, scalable fission and fusion (full supply chain).
* **Defense:** Radically cheaper, intelligent weapons to defend democracies against invasion (full supply chain).
* **Silicon:** Blazing fast open source toolchains and radically faster, cheaper nanoscale fabrication techniques.
* **Government:** Anything with the potential to make democratic governments and discourse vastly more functional.
* **Education:** A true Diamond Age Primer would change billions of lives.

[^physics]: Physics is #2 because it's much harder to assess than scale.
[^ethics]: Ethics is #4 because anything that satisfies #1-3 will be realized given enough time. If that's a bad outcome we want to understand the dynamics involved and fund something to prevent it.
